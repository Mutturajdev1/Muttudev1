5 . 5.	Multithreaded Java Application
o	Develop a Java-based multithreaded application to process six tasks (A, B, C, D, E, and F) with the following execution flow:
	Tasks A & B should run in parallel.
	Tasks C & D should run in parallel after A & B complete.
	The output of A & B should be fed into C & D.
	The output of C & D should be fed into F for final processing.
o	Design the application to handle success and failure modes for each task to ensure robustness and reliability.

Step 1 .
Use ExecutorService for managing and creating threads.

step2 .
create dependency and parallel execution on threads to get results from A & B, then pass them to C & D. and then pass output of C & D to F

Step3 .
Monitor tasks as they finish.

Step4 :
Use proper try-catch blocks to handle failures and Success.
